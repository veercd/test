## :pencil: Process

> **:loudspeaker:** The process below is independent of the [level](#level_slider-levels). 

### 1. Application

   1. [Fork](https://github.com/veercd/test/fork) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork,if you participate in infrastructure, create a copy of the infrastructure template ([`infrastructure/infrastructure-template.md`](infrastructure/infrastructure-template.md)),if you participate in DApp, create a copy of the DApp template ([`dapp/dapp-template.md`](dapp/dapp-template.md)). 
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our [Interested Grant List](docs/interestlist.md) and make sure your deliverables present a similar same level of detail. To get an idea of what a strong application looks like . Naturally, if you're only applying for a smaller grant that only consists of, say, UI work, you don't need to provide as much detail.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain _one new file_—the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.
   7. Sign off on the [terms and conditions](docs/T&Cs.md) presented by the [CLA assistant](https://github.com/claassistantio) bot as a Contributor License Agreement. You might need to reload the pull request to see its comment.

### 2. Application Review

   1. The AELF DAO can (and usually does) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by directly modifying your application and leaving a comment once you're done. Generally, if you don't reply within 2 weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.
   3. When all requested changes are addressed and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` .
   4. The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives the required number of approvals (see [levels](#level_slider-levels)), or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

### 3. Milestone Delivery and Payment

   1. Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/veercd/test2) repository following the [process](https://github.com/veercd/test2) described therein.

### Changes to a Grant after Approval

- Accepted grant applications can be amended at any time. However, this may need to be reassessed (according to the [levels](#level_slider-levels)). 
- If your deliveries are significantly delayed and we cannot get a hold of you, We will not give grants .
